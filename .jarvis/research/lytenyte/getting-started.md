  Get started with LyteNyte Grid, a modern React data grid designed for enterprise-scale data challenges.
  Built in React, for React, it enables developers to ship faster and more efficiently than ever before.

  No wrappers. No dependencies. Open code.
---

## Our Motivation

Before LyteNyte Grid, we were trapped in a cycle of frustration with bloated, brittle,
and over-engineered data grid libraries. Every new project
became a ritual of fighting APIs that felt like they were written by a
committee that never used React.

Here's what we kept running into again and again:

- **Customization was a nightmare.** Clunky, opaque APIs made even basic tweaks feel like defusing
  a bomb. Two-way data bindings and state sync issues between React and the grid... _we've seen it all_.

- **Server data loading was a disaster.** Optimistic updates, partial rendering, and caching
  never worked properly, or worse, worked sometimes, which is somehow more dangerous.

- **Performance collapsed under pressure.** Beyond trivial datasets, most grids fell apart.
  Virtualization failed. Re-renders multiplied. Main thread got blocked. Users rage-quit.

- **Breaking changes broke more than code.** New versions came with surprises, and not the
  fun kind. We were refactoring the same grid logic every quarter just to stay afloat.

- **Styling was their way or no way.** We were forced to adopt unfamiliar styling systems
  just to make things look half-decent, adding yet another layer of complexity.

- **Bundle sizes were obscene.** Grid libraries ballooned app load times by 1-3
  seconds, sometimes longer.

So… We patched, duct-taped, forked, and cursed. Over time, our quick fixes turned into long-term liabilities.
Technical debt grew. Dev velocity dropped. Maintenance costs soared.
All because the tools we relied on couldn't keep up.

We built **LyteNyte Grid** to end that cycle.

## Why LyteNyte Grid Stands Out

At the heart of LyteNyte Grid is a commitment to the developer and user experience
based on the principle of 'seamless simplicity.'

Here's why we stand out:

- ⚛️ **Clean, Declarative API:** LyteNyte Grid exposes a minimal, declarative API aligned with React's
  data flow and state model. No wrappers. No adapter layers. No awkward integrations.
  Only cleaner, more maintainable code.

- 📦 **Tiny Bundle Size:** Core edition is a tiny **30kb gzipped**, while the PRO edition weighs
  only **40kb gzipped**, so you no longer have to choose between advanced
  functionality and a fast user experience.

- ⚡ **Unrivaled Speed:** LyteNyte can handle **10,000+ updates per second** and render millions of rows.
  Our reactive state architecture means performance doesn't degrade when paginating,
  filtering, or pulling from the server.

- 🧩 **Headless by Design, Components Included:** An industry first. Ultimate flexibility to choose
  between our pre-styled themes or drop into full headless mode for 100% control.
  Covering any use case you may have for a data table.

- 🏢 **Feature-Rich, Enterprise Ready:** Handles the most demanding workflows with a
  comprehensive feature set that includes pivot tables, tree data, server-side loading,
  custom cell rendering, rich cell editing, and more, all from a single package, giving
  you one consistent API to build with.

- 🫶 **Simple Licensing, Transparent Support:** Straightforward licensing options. All support is
  handled publicly on GitHub. You get complete transparency into our response times.

## Core Edition vs. PRO Edition

LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions: **Core** and **PRO**.

LyteNyte Grid PRO is built on top of LyteNyte Grid Core, so it includes all Core
features plus advanced capabilities for the most demanding enterprise use cases.
This architecture ensures a seamless upgrade path. You can start with Core and
switch to PRO later without refactoring, since it's a non-breaking, drop-in replacement.

- **LyteNyte Core Edition:** Free, open source ([Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)),
  and genuinely useful. Includes essential features such as sorting, filtering, row grouping, column auto-sizing,
  detail views, data exporting, and others.

- **LyteNyte Grid PRO Edition:** A commercial edition ([EULA](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula))
  with advanced capabilities like server data loading, column and filter manager components,
  tree data, column pivoting, and more sophisticated data table tools.

To determine if a feature is exclusively part of the PRO edition, look for the <ProTag /> icon
next to the feature name on the navigation bar.

For a complete feature comparison between Core and PRO, check out
our [pricing page](https://www.1771technologies.com/pricing).

## Quick Start

In this guide, you will build a data table inspired by the log tables in Vercel and DataDog.

[Vite getting started docs](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

:::

### Import LyteNyte Grid

LyteNyte Grid uses a modular design to minimize bundle size. The library exposes named
exports to maximize tree-shaking.

`Grid` is the main export. `Grid` is a React component, and it includes additional component
functions attached to it. In this guide, you only need the `Grid` function.
See the [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts) for advanced usage of the
different component parts that make up LyteNyte Grid.

Start by:

1. Importing the `Grid` function.
2. Defining the grid columns.

The code below shows each part. The rest of this guide builds on this code,
so if you are following along in your editor, copy it.

```tsx
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/light-dark.css";
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";

//!next "1" 1
const columns: Grid.Column<GridSpec>[] = [
  { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime" },
  { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100 },
  { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100 },
  { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase" },
  { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname" },
  { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number" },
  { id: "region", name: "Region" },
];

export default function GettingStarted() {
  return (
    //!next "2" 1
    <div className="ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      {/*!next "3" 1 */}
      <Grid columns={columns} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The annotated lines mark important parts:

1. Defines the set of column definitions. The grid uses these definitions to display content.
   To learn more about the available properties, see the [Column Overview guide](/docs/columns).
2. Creates a `400px`-tall container for the grid. LyteNyte Grid virtualizes rows by default,
   so the grid needs a container with a height to fill. See the [Responsive Container guide](/docs/grid-container)
   for different approaches to creating a grid container. The container also applies the `ln-grid` class.
   LyteNyte Grid requires the `ln-grid` class for the pre-made styles. To learn more about styling, see
   the [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming).
3. Renders the grid. This example uses the default `Grid` component API. You can also use LyteNyte Grid
   in a headless fashion by providing `children`. To learn more about headless usage, see the
   [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

### Providing Data to the Grid

LyteNyte Grid reads data from a row data source. The most common option is a
client-side data source. Use the client-side data source when all row data is available in the browser.

Next you will:

1. Import the row data and the data source hook.
2. Create a row data source from the imported data and pass it to the grid.

```tsx
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/light-dark.css";
import { Grid, useClientDataSource } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro"; //! "1"

import { requestData, type RequestData } from "./data.js"; //! "2"

//!next "3" 3
interface GridSpec {
  data: RequestData;
}

const columns: Grid.Column<GridSpec>[] = [
  { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime" },
  { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100 },
  { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100 },
  { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase" },
  { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname" },
  { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number" },
  { id: "region", name: "Region" },
];

export default function GettingStarted() {
  //!next "4" 3
  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
  });

  return (
    <div className="ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid columns={columns} rowSource={ds} /> {/*! */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The annotated code marks the important changes.

1. Import the `useClientDataSource` hook from the LyteNyte package. Use the client-side data source
   hook when the browser already has all row data.
2. Import `requestData` from `./data.js`. This guide assumes you downloaded the data for the demo
   and created a `data.js` (or `data.ts`) file. You can download or copy the data file from the
   LyteNyte Grid GitHub repository [here](<https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/blob/main/documentation-v2/docs/(introduction)/demos/getting-started/data.ts>).
   Create a local `data.js` file in the same folder as the file that renders the grid.
3. Create a `GridSpec` type. LyteNyte Grid uses TypeScript for code completion and type checking.
   The grid cannot know the row data type ahead of time, so you define a specification interface
   and pass it as the type parameter to the relevant grid types.
   The specification interface can do more than define the row data type, as will be covered in
   a later section of this guide. For best practices on using [TypeScript](/docs/prodready-typescript)
   with LyteNyte Grid, see the [TypeScript guide](/docs/prodready-typescript).
4. Call the `useClientDataSource` hook and pass in `requestData`. Then set the grid's `rowSource`
   property to the `ds` value returned from `useClientDataSource`.

If you followed along to this point you will have a working grid, but a very plain looking view. The demo
below shows what the result looks like. The example looks plain, and not every column displays a value.
LyteNyte Grid's default cell renderer only displays simple values, such as strings or numbers. For complex
values, you must provide a custom cell renderer, as will be demonstrated next.

::demo[Basic Grid="./demos/getting-started_functional"]

## Custom Cell Renderer

A custom cell renderer is a normal React component. LyteNyte Grid passes the cell renderer
cell-specific properties, defined by the [CellRendererParams](/docs/reference/grid-types#cell-params)
type.

You set a cell renderer on the column definitions you pass to the grid. Start by defining a cell renderer
for the **Timing Phase** column. The code block below collapses the implementation, because a cell renderer can contain
any React content you want.

Focus on the function definition. You define a cell renderer by creating a React component
that accepts `CellRendererParams`. This example also uses the `GridSpec` type, defined earlier,
to improve type checking.

```tsx
//#start
import type { CellRendererParams } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/types";
const colors = ["var(--transfer)", "var(--dns)", "var(--connection)", "var(--ttfb)", "var(--tls)"];
//#end

export function TimingPhaseCell({ api, row }: CellRendererParams<GridSpec>) {
  //#start
  // Guard against rows that are not leaves or rows that have no data.
  if (!api.rowIsLeaf(row) || !row.data) return;

  const total =
    row.data["timing-phase.connection"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.dns"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.tls"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.transfer"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.ttfb"];

  const connectionPer = (row.data["timing-phase.connection"] / total) * 100;
  const dnsPer = (row.data["timing-phase.dns"] / total) * 100;
  const tlPer = (row.data["timing-phase.tls"] / total) * 100;
  const transferPer = (row.data["timing-phase.transfer"] / total) * 100;
  const ttfbPer = (row.data["timing-phase.ttfb"] / total) * 100;

  const values = [connectionPer, dnsPer, tlPer, transferPer, ttfbPer];

  return (
    <div className="flex h-full w-full items-center">
      <div className="flex h-4 w-full items-center gap-px overflow-hidden">
        {values.map((v, i) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={i}
              style={{ width: `${v}%`, background: colors[i] }}
              className={clsx("h-full rounded-sm")}
            />
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
  //#end
}
```

Now that you know how to define cell renderers, set the `cellRenderer` property on the
columns. The updated column code is shown below.

```tsx
//#start
import "./main.css";
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/light-dark.css";
import { Grid, useClientDataSource } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";

import type { RequestData } from "./data.js";
import { requestData } from "./data.js";

export interface GridSpec {
  data: RequestData;
}
//#end

import {
  DateCell,
  LatencyCell,
  MethodCell,
  PathnameCell,
  RegionCell,
  StatusCell,
  TimingPhaseCell,
} from "./components.js";

//!next 9
const columns: Grid.Column<GridSpec>[] = [
  { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime", cellRenderer: DateCell },
  { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100, cellRenderer: StatusCell },
  { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100, cellRenderer: MethodCell },
  { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase", cellRenderer: TimingPhaseCell },
  { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname", cellRenderer: PathnameCell },
  { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number", cellRenderer: LatencyCell },
  { id: "region", name: "Region", cellRenderer: RegionCell },
];

//#start
export default function GettingStarted() {
  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
  });

  return (
    <div className="ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid columns={columns} rowSource={ds} />
    </div>
  );
}
//#end
```

:::note

We use Tailwind CSS to style components. LyteNyte Grid has no opinion on which styling
framework you use. If you follow this guide line by line and want the cell renderers to
render correctly, set up Tailwind by following the [Tailwind installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) and
apply our [Tailwind theme configuration](/docs/grid-theming-tailwind).

The cell renderers also use custom CSS properties for colors. The CSS below defines those properties:

```css
:root {
  --transfer: #7badff;
  --dns: #126cff;
  --connection: #053f9e;
  --ttfb: #7c8193;
  --tls: #c0c7d1;
}

.dark {
  --transfer: #2be4ce;
  --dns: #03b6a1;
  --connection: #008c7b;
  --ttfb: #6a6c73;
  --tls: #bfc3c9;
}
```

For general theming and best practices, see the [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming).

:::

The cell renderers live in the `components.js` file. You can create this file yourself or copy our implementation
from [GitHub](<https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/blob/main/documentation-v2/docs/(introduction)/demos/getting-started/components.tsx>).
A full working example is shown below.

::demo[Cell Renderers="./demos/getting-started_cell-renderers"]

The grid now looks much better, but you can still add more features. In the sections that follow,
you will:

1. Add the ability to sort columns. You will do this by extending the column definition with a custom `sort` property.
2. Make every row a master-detail row that expands to reveal more information about the row data.

All the features in these sections work in both the Core and PRO editions of LyteNyte Grid, so you can follow along
regardless of which edition you use.

## Column Sorting

LyteNyte Grid can sort rows by a specific column. To enable sorting, you will:

1. Extend the column definition with a `sort` property.
2. Store the columns in React state, so you can update them through the LyteNyte Grid API.
3. Provide a custom header renderer that sorts by a column when the user clicks the header.

### Extending Columns

Start by extending the column definition in the `GridSpec` interface, as shown below:

```ts
export interface GridSpec {
  data: RequestData;
  column: { sort?: "asc" | "desc" | null }; //!
}
```

This change only affects TypeScript. If you use JavaScript, you can safely ignore this section.

### Controlled Column State

Next, store the columns in React state. The simplest way to do this is with `useState`, as shown in the code below:

```tsx
export default function GettingStarted() {
  //!next 1
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState<Grid.Column<GridSpec>[]>([
    { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime", cellRenderer: DateCell },
    { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100, cellRenderer: StatusCell },
    { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100, cellRenderer: MethodCell },
    { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase", cellRenderer: TimingPhaseCell },
    { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname", cellRenderer: PathnameCell },
    { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number", cellRenderer: LatencyCell },
    { id: "region", name: "Region", cellRenderer: RegionCell },
  ]);

  //#start
  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
    sort,
  });
  //#end

  return (
    <div className="demo ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid
        columns={columns} //!
        onColumnsChange={setColumns} //!
        rowSource={ds}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code passes the state-backed `columns` to the grid, additionally it passes the `setColumns` state setter
to the `onColumnsChange` prop. This lets the grid update column state when the user interacts with
the grid.

### Header Renderer

With the column definitions in place, create a header renderer that sorts a column when the user clicks it. You can
set a header renderer on a column with the `headerRenderer` property. Since all columns use the same header renderer,
set `headerRenderer` on the base column through the grid's `columnBase` property.

```tsx
//!next 3
const base: Grid.Props<GridSpec>["columnBase"] = {
  headerRenderer: Header,
};

export default function GettingStarted() {
  //#start
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState<Grid.Column<GridSpec>[]>([
    { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime", cellRenderer: DateCell },
    { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100, cellRenderer: StatusCell },
    { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100, cellRenderer: MethodCell },
    { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase", cellRenderer: TimingPhaseCell },
    { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname", cellRenderer: PathnameCell },
    { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number", cellRenderer: LatencyCell },
    { id: "region", name: "Region", cellRenderer: RegionCell },
  ]);

  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
    sort,
  });
  //#end

  return (
    <div className="demo ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid
        columns={columns}
        onColumnsChange={setColumns}
        columnBase={base} //!
        rowSource={ds}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next, define the header renderer and use it to update column state. The code below uses an `onClick` handler to build
a column update by cycling through sort states for the clicked column. The handler then calls `api.columnUpdate`, which
produces an updated set of columns. When `api.columnUpdate` runs, the grid calls `onColumnsChange` with the new columns.

```tsx
export function Header({ api, column }: HeaderParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    <div
      //!next 20
      onClick={() => {
        const columns = api.props().columns;
        if (!columns) return;

        const updates: Record<string, Partial<Grid.Column<GridSpec>>> = {};
        const columnsWithSort = columns.filter((x) => x.sort);

        columnsWithSort.forEach((x) => {
          updates[x.id] = { sort: null };
        });

        if (column.sort === "asc") {
          updates[column.id] = { sort: null };
        } else if (column.sort === "desc") {
          updates[column.id] = { sort: "asc" };
        } else {
          updates[column.id] = { sort: "desc" };
        }

        api.columnUpdate(updates);
      }}
    >
      {/*#start */}
      <div className="sort-button flex w-full items-center justify-between rounded px-1 py-1 transition-colors">
        {column.name ?? column.id}
        {column.sort === "asc" && <ArrowUpIcon className="text-ln-text-dark size-4" />}
        {column.sort === "desc" && <ArrowDownIcon className="text-ln-text-dark size-4" />}
      </div>
      {/*#end */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally, pass a sort model to the client row data source. Create the sort model by deriving the value
from the column state. The code below derives a sort model from the columns which have a `sort` value
set on their specification.

```tsx
export default function GettingStarted() {
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState<Grid.Column<GridSpec>[]>([
    //#start
    { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime", cellRenderer: DateCell },
    { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100, cellRenderer: StatusCell },
    { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100, cellRenderer: MethodCell },
    { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase", cellRenderer: TimingPhaseCell },
    { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname", cellRenderer: PathnameCell },
    { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number", cellRenderer: LatencyCell },
    { id: "region", name: "Region", cellRenderer: RegionCell },
    //#end
  ]);

  //!next 9
  const sort = useMemo<UseClientDataSourceParams<GridSpec>["sort"]>(() => {
    const colWithSort = columns.find((x) => x.sort);
    if (!colWithSort) return null;

    if (sortComparators[colWithSort.id])
      return [{ dim: sortComparators[colWithSort.id], descending: colWithSort.sort === "desc" }];

    return [{ dim: colWithSort, descending: colWithSort.sort === "desc" }];
  }, [columns]);

  //#start
  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
    sort,
  });

  return (
    <div className="demo ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid
        columns={columns}
        onColumnsChange={setColumns}
        columnBase={base}
        rowSource={ds}
        rowDetailRenderer={RowDetailRenderer}
        columnMarker={marker}
      />
    </div>
  );
  //#end
}
```

A full working example with column sorting is shown below.

::demo[Sorting Demo="./demos/getting-started-with-sort"]

## Row Master Detail

LyteNyte Grid supports row detail information, also known as master detail.
This section covers the basic setup and functionality. For more information, see the
[Row Master Detail guide](/docs/row-detail).

To enable row master detail, you will:

1. Define a detail renderer.
2. Enable LyteNyte Grid's [marker column](/docs/marker-column) and provide a cell renderer that
   toggles the row detail expansion state.

### Row Detail Renderer

A row detail renderer is a React component that LyteNyte Grid uses to render the detail area for an expanded
row. Set the renderer on the grid's `rowDetailRenderer` property, as shown below:

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  onColumnsChange={setColumns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowDetailRenderer={RowDetailRenderer} //!
/>
```

The renderer is a normal React component that receives row props from LyteNyte Grid. The definition of a detail
renderer is shown below. The content is collapsed because the important line is the function definition. A row
detail renderer can return any React content. The key requirements are that the function returns a valid
`ReactNode` and accepts `RowParams` as a prop.

```tsx
//!next 1
export function RowDetailRenderer({ row, api }: RowParams<GridSpec>) {
  //#start
  // Guard against empty data.
  if (!api.rowIsLeaf(row) || !row.data) return null;

  const total =
    row.data["timing-phase.connection"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.dns"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.tls"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.transfer"] +
    row.data["timing-phase.ttfb"];

  const connectionPer = (row.data["timing-phase.connection"] / total) * 100;
  const dnsPer = (row.data["timing-phase.dns"] / total) * 100;
  const tlPer = (row.data["timing-phase.tls"] / total) * 100;

### Marker Column

After you define the row detail renderer, you need a way to toggle the visibility of each detail row.
LyteNyte Grid's [marker column](/docs/marker-column) provides the perfect place to add this functionality.

The marker column is a special column that LyteNyte Grid creates and manages. LyteNyte always pins the marker
column to the start of the grid, and the marker column does not appear in the `columns` array you
pass to the grid. Use the marker column for auxiliary row actions such as row selection or row detail expansion.

To enable the marker column, set the grid's `columnMarker` property to a marker column definition, as shown below:

```tsx
//!next 5
const marker: Grid.Props<GridSpec>["columnMarker"] = {
  on: true,
  width: 40,
  cellRenderer: MarkerCell,
};

export default function GettingStarted() {
  //#start
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState<Grid.Column<GridSpec>[]>([
    { id: "Date", name: "Date", width: 200, type: "datetime", cellRenderer: DateCell },
    { id: "Status", name: "Status", width: 100, cellRenderer: StatusCell },
    { id: "Method", name: "Method", width: 100, cellRenderer: MethodCell },
    { id: "timing-phase", name: "Timing Phase", cellRenderer: TimingPhaseCell },
    { id: "Pathname", name: "Pathname", cellRenderer: PathnameCell },
    { id: "Latency", name: "Latency", width: 120, type: "number", cellRenderer: LatencyCell },
    { id: "region", name: "Region", cellRenderer: RegionCell },
  ]);

  const sort = useMemo<UseClientDataSourceParams<GridSpec>["sort"]>(() => {
    const colWithSort = columns.find((x) => x.sort);
    if (!colWithSort) return null;

    if (sortComparators[colWithSort.id])
      return [{ dim: sortComparators[colWithSort.id], descending: colWithSort.sort === "desc" }];

    return [{ dim: colWithSort, descending: colWithSort.sort === "desc" }];
  }, [columns]);

  const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
    data: requestData,
    sort,
  });
  //#end

  return (
    <div className="demo ln-grid" style={{ height: 400 }}>
      <Grid
        columns={columns}
        onColumnsChange={setColumns}
        columnBase={base}
        rowSource={ds}
        rowDetailRenderer={RowDetailRenderer}
        columnMarker={marker} //!
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The marker column uses the `MarkerCell` component as its cell renderer. The `MarkerCell` definition is shown
below. Focus on the `api.rowDetailToggle` method, which toggles the row detail expansion state for a given row.
Use this method to show and hide row detail areas.

```tsx
export function MarkerCell({ detailExpanded, row, api }: CellRendererParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    {/*!next */}
    <button onClick={() => api.rowDetailToggle(row)}>
      {detailExpanded ? (
        <ChevronDownIcon width={20} height={20} />
      ) : (
        <ChevronRightIcon width={20} height={20} />
      )}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Putting everything together, the full working example is shown below:
